# fastauth

This repo is part of the series [TDD Auth with FastAPI](https://santoshk.dev/series/tdd-auth-with-fastapi/). This series covers the basics of Test Driven Developement and FastAPI, thus the name fastauth.

The series covers the setup and writing of a basic authentication system which can let users register and login. On some routes, only logged in user can access the route.

We have also talked about **mocking** and **dependency injection**.
